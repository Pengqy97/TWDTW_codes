Time-Weighted Dynamic Time Warping for satellite image time series analysis

The TWDTW codes provides a full calculation of the Time-Weighted Dynamic Time Warping (TWDTW) method for maize mapping using fused NDVI time series (Maus et al. 2016). TWDTW codes provides full cycle of maize classification using image time series, ranging from calculating the distance between two series to classifying through the threshold (Peng, et al. 2023).
